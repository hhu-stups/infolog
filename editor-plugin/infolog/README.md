# Infolog Atom plugin

An Atom editor plugin for the Infolog program analysis tool.

# Installation

To use the Atom plugin, SICStus Prolog needs to be installed.  To
install the plugin, install the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) and
navigate to the directory this README file is located in, and run

```
apm install linter-ui-default
apm link .
```

This will install the plugin's dependencies and link the plugin itself
to be usable by Atom.  After starting Atom, you will be prompted to
install additional dependencies once, afterwards they will be kept
updated by the editor's update system.

# Documentation
Detailed technical documentation of the plugin can be found in my
Bachelor's thesis "An Atom editor plugin for the Infolog program
analysis tool."
